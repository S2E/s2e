/// In S2E, the register file is split in two regions:

/// contains control registers.
///
/// Only the first region may contain symbolic data. Any symbolic
/// data written to the second region will be immediately concretized.

/// Limitations:
///   - Since FP, MMX, SSE registers are currently located in
///     the concrete region, they may not hold symbolic data.
///   - It is currently not possible to perform read/write operations that
///     span the symbolic and the concrete region.
