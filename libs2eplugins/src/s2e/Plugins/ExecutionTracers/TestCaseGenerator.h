/// \brief Generate test cases when states are killed and provides APIs to generate
/// test cases on-demand.
///
/// This plugin supports two types of test cases:
/// - Basic concrete input assignments. This is the simplest form, where each
///   symbolic variable will have its concrete value printed when the state terminates.
/// - Concrete files. This reconstructs complete concrete input files from
///   the symbolic variable names. The names must have a special encoding in order to be
///   reconstructed into files by this plugin.
///
/// Concrete file test cases
/// ========================
///
/// In order to make a file symbolic, the guest must create one or more symbolic
/// variables and write them over the original concrete data present in the file.
/// The symbolic variables must cover all the file without overlaps so that the
/// test case generator plugin can reassemble these variables and write back the concrete
/// data computed by the constraint solver to the right file locations.
///
/// In order for the concrete files to be assembled properly, the symbolic variable
/// names must follow this pattern:
///
/// .*?__symfile___(.+?)___(\\d+)_(\\d+)_symfile__.*
///
///                  ^--1    ^--2    ^--3
///
/// Group 1: this is the sanitized name of the symbolic file. Symbolic variable names
/// cannot have any special characters, so tools that create symbolic files (e.g., s2ecmd)
/// must first strip all non-alphanumerical characters and replace them with underscores.
///
/// Group 2: this is the chunk identifier of the data encoded by the symbolic variable.
/// The plugin sorts chunks by increasing indentifiers and writes them consecutively to the
/// concrete file. For performance reasons, the guest would  typically split a large file
/// into chunks of equal-sized symbolic variables (e.g., 4KB). When chunk size is 1, the
/// chunk identifier is the offset of the byte in the test case file.
///
/// Group 3: this is the total number of chunks. The test case generator plugin uses
/// this as a sanity check to make sure all variable names are present and no chunk is
/// missing. When chunk size is 1, this value is equal to the concrete file size.
///
/// The following symbolic variable name of size 1 encodes a chunk for the x__image_iso file name
/// (which was stripped from the original x:\image.iso), starting at offset 47105. The
/// expected total file size is 368640.
///
/// v1___symfile___x__image_iso___47105_368640_symfile___1
///
/// Partial symbolic files
/// ======================
///
/// Simetimes input files are large and making them entirely symbolic is impractial.
/// The test case generator plugin provides a mechanism to make only a subset of bytes
/// symbolic, while keeping the rest concrete. Here is how it works:
///
/// 1. The guest sends the original concrete input file and its sanitized name to the plugin.
///    This is the concrete file template.
/// 2. The guest creates symbolic variable names only for those bytes that must be
///    symbolic.
/// 3. When generating the test case, the plugin first writes the original concrete
///    input file template and then overwrites the parts that where made symbolic with concrete
///    bytes computed by the constraint solver.
///
/// For example, if a user has a file whose size is 16 bytes and wants to make
/// bytes 1 and 6 symbolic, the user will proceed as follows:
///
/// 1. Send "01 43 44 30 30 31 01 00  4c 49 4e 55 58 20 20 20" to the plugin
///    together with its sanitized name, e.g., "input_txt".
///
/// 2. Create the following symbolic variables of 1 byte each with the following names:
///    __symfile___input_txt___1_16_symfile__
///    __symfile___input_txt___6_16_symfile__
///
/// 3. Suppose the constraint solver assigns 0x12 and 0x77 for the 2nd and 7th bytes
///    respectively. The test case will look as follows:
///
///    "01 12 44 30 30 31 77 00  4c 49 4e 55 58 20 20 20"
///        ^^--           ^^--modified bytes
///
/// Notes:
///
/// - When using partial symbolic files, the chunk size must be one.
