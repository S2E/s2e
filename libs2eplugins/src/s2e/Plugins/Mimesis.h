     * Note that this signal may be emitted when executing program instructions that are \b not necessarily branch
     * instructions. For example, when dereferencing symbolic memory a number of helper functions are called (see
     * \c TCGLLVMTranslator::initialzeHelpers) which may also cause fork branches. Depending on: the program
     * instruction; memory accessed; and helper functions called, this may cause \c onStateForkDecide to be emitted
     * multiple times for the same execution of a program instruction.
     *
     * Some optimization is performed so that the signal is \b not emitted when the fork condition is a constant
     * expression (see \c S2EExecutor::fork). However, there may still be instances when the \c onStateForkDecide
     * signal is emitted and fork branches are not actually guaranteed to occur (e.g. the constraint solver may decide
     * not to fork branches).
     *
     * It is up to the signal handler to handle these cases. The signal handler **must not** assume that:
     *   - The fork is occurring at a branch instruction in the program code
     *   - The fork will actually occur, even if the pointer is set to \c true (ultimately this is up to the constraint
     *   solver)
     *   - The signal will only be emitted once when a program instruction that \a may fork is executed.
     *
     * Plugins set the pointer to \c true to allow forking to proceed. By default this is set to \c true.
