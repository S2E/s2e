DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge
===========================

DARPA's `Cyber Grand Challenge <http://archive.darpa.mil/cybergrandchallenge/>`_ (CGC) was the world's first all-machine hacking
tournament. S2E was a key component in CodeJitsu's Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) and was used to automatically to find
vulnerabilities and exploit them. This demo walks you through the process of using S2E to find and generate a "proof of
vulnerability" (POV - i.e. an exploit) in a CGC challenge binary (CB).

.. Note::

    You may want to refer to the tutorial on `Automated Generation of Proofs of Vulnerability with S2E <pov.rst>`_
    in order to understand what S2E does behind the scenes in order to generate PoVs.

Setting up the S2E environment
------------------------------

The first step is to setup the environment. This can be done automatically using the ``s2e-env`` tool.
Follow `these <../s2e-env.rst>`_ instructions to create your S2E environment and build S2E.

Creating a CGC image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CGC Final Event (CFE) ran on the DECREE operating system. DECREE is a modified Linux OS with a reduced number of
`system calls  <https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/libcgc>`_. In addition to this, the DECREE OS has been modified
to add "hook points" for S2E (e.g. to signal process creation, termination, etc.) and to allow S2E to inject symbolic
values. The source code for the DECREE OS is available at https://github.com/S2E/s2e-linux-kernel. A DECREE
virtual machine image can be built by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    s2e image_build cgc_debian-8.7.1-i386

Analyzing a sample CB
---------------------

Once we have an image we can start analyzing CBs. Sample CBs are available `here
<https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/samples>`_ and can be built using the instructions `here
<https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/cgc-release-documentation/blob/master/walk-throughs/building-a-cb.md>`_ . The
remainder of this tutorial will focus on the CADET_00001 program (which is available `here
<https://github.com/S2E/decree/blob/master/samples/CADET_00001>`_), but the ideas and techniques should be applicable
to all of the CBs.


Creating a project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have built the CADET_00001 binary you can create an S2E analysis project using ``s2e-env``. To do so, run:

.. code-block:: console

    s2e new_project --image cgc_debian-8.7.1-i386 ./source/s2e/decree/samples/CADET_00001

This will create a ``projects/CADET_00001`` directory with various scripts and configuration files needed by S2E, as
described `here <../s2e-env.rst>`_. Lets examine some of the generated files.

s2e-config.lua
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of CGC-specific plugins enabled in ``s2e-config.lua``. These are:

CGCInterface
    Coordinates all the CGC plugins.

DecreeMonitor
    Plugin that tracks various system events (e.g. segmentation fault, process creation, etc.) in the DECREE OS.

ExploitGenerator
    Plugin that combines the information from the ``Recipe`` and ``POVGenerator`` plugins to generate an actual
    exploit.

POVGenerator
    Plugin for generating POVs using the `standard
    <https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/cgc-release-documentation/blob/master/cfe-pov-markup-spec.txt>`_ defined by
    DARPA.

Recipe
    Used for defining the conditions necessary for exploit generation. S2E supports `Type 1 and Type 2
    <https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/cgc-release-documentation/blob/master/walk-throughs/understanding-cfe-povs.md>`_
    POVs. POV generation will not work without recipes.

Other plugins that are required for CB analysis but are not specific to the CGC include:

SeedSearcher
    Seed files (or test inputs) are concrete inputs for the program under analysis. These files can be anything that
    the program accepts (PNG files, documents, etc.). They can be obtained from a fuzzer, generated by hand, etc.
    For CGC, seeds are binary executables compiled from XML of C PoV format.

    The ``SeedSearcher`` plugin fetches seed files to concolically guide execution in the target program. Seed files
    are placed in the seeds directory.  During analysis, the ``SeedSearcher`` plugins polls the seeds directory for new
    seeds.When it finds new seeds, the plugin forks a new state that fetches the new seed and then runs the binary
    using that seed as input.

    Seed files can have different priorities. For example, if a fuzzer finds a seed that crashes the program, S2E may
    want to use that seed before others that, e.g., only cover new basic blocks. The priority of a seed is specified in
    its name. Seed files use the following naming convention::

       <index>-<priority>.<extension>

    The index specifies the order of the seed. ``SeedSearcher`` fetches seed files by increasing index number. Higher
    priorities are specified with higher integer. In a given batch of seeds, ``SeedSearcher`` will schedule those with
    the highest priority first.

    When there are many seed files, it is advantageous to run S2E on multiple cores. In this mode, the ``SeedSearcher``
    will automatically load balance available seeds across all available cores. For example, if there are 40 cores
    available, ``SeedSearcher`` will attempt to run 40 seeds in parallel.

    The ``SeedSearcher`` plugin works in conjunction with the guest bootstrap file. The bootstrap file is built in such
    a way that state 0 runs in an infinite loop and forks a new state when a new seed is available. If there are no
    seed files, the bootstrap forks a state in which the program is run without seeds.


CUPA Searcher
    This searcher implements the Class Uniform Path Analysis (CUPA) algorithm as described in `this
    <http://www.stefanbucur.net/assets/pubs/chef.pdf>`_ paper. It can work together with the ``SeedSearcher`` plugin.

The bootstrap script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bootstrap script is a file called ``bootstrap.sh`` that the guest fetches from the host and executes. It contains
instructions on how to execute the program under analysis. More detail can be found in the `s2e-env <../s2e-env.rst>`_
documentation.

The CGC ``bootstrap.sh`` script slightly differs from Linux bootstraps. One key difference is that seeds will always be
enabled for CGC projects, so the ``while`` loop in the ``execute`` function will exist even if you do not intend to use
seed files. Note that it will not affect symbolic execution - the ``SeedSearcher`` (described above) will simply never
schedule this state (state 0) for execution. This state will always exist, which means that even if S2E explores all
execution paths in the CB (which is possible for simple binaries such as CADET_00001), the analysis will not end
because not all states have been killed. The analysis must therefore be manually stopped.

Starting an analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start S2E, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    s2e run CADET_00001

This will display a TUI-based dashboard, similar to that used by the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer. As S2E finds
vulnerabilities, it generates POV files in the ``s2e-last`` directory. These files have either ``.xml`` or ``.c``
file extensions. Once some POV files have been generated you can press ``q`` to stop S2E.

.. image:: ../img/cadet_00001_tui.png

Alternatively, you can run S2E without the TUI by using the ``-n`` option in ``s2e run``. Instead of the TUI you will
see the standard S2E output.  Once some POVs have been generated you can stop S2E by killing the process with
``Ctrl+C`` or ``killall -9 qemu-system-i386``.

For a deeper understanding of what S2E is doing you may wish to have a look at the ``debug.txt`` log file in
``s2e-last``.

Replaying POVs
--------------

POVs are an XML description of an exploit (for more detail, see `here
<https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/cgc-release-documentation/blob/master/walk-throughs/understanding-cfe-povs.md>`_).
They can be compiled to C code and then to an executable format to test that the exploit is correct.

1. Follow the instructions `here
   <https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/cgc-release-documentation/blob/master/walk-throughs/running-the-vm.md>`_ to
   setup and run the CGC testing VM
2. As discussed in the instructions in the previous step, files can be shared between the host and CGC testing VM via
   the ``/vagrant`` directory. Copy the CADET_00001 binary, the POV XML files generated by S2E and `this
   <https://github.com/S2E/cgc/blob/master/scripts/test_pov.sh>`_ script (located in your S2E environment in
   ``bin/cgc-tools/test_pov.sh``) to the CGC testing VM.
3. Run ``vagrant ssh`` to access the VM and copy the files from ``/vagrant`` into ``/home/vagrant``. Then run the
   ``test_pov.sh`` script to check your POV's correctness.
