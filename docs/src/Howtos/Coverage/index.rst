Measuring code coverage with S2E
================================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to measure code coverage of binaries on various OSes with S2E.
Here are some advantages of using S2E for that:

- You do not have to recompile your binaries with GCOV support or similar in order to get
  code coverage. You do not even need debug information if all you want is basic block coverage.

- You can get code coverage for any part of the software stack (program, library, kernel modules, and even
  the kernel itself).

- You can get LCOV HTML reports when source code is available and the binary has suitable debug information

- You can get basic block coverage reports integrated with IDA or Radare.

- You do not even need to use symbolic execution. You could use S2E as a powerful single-path coverage tool.

This tutorial covers the following topics:

- How to configure S2E to record line and basic block coverage
- How to generate HTML reports with LCOV
- Examples for Linux and Windows covering programs, libraries, and kernel drivers
- How S2E records coverage information under the hood so that you can extend it for your own needs


.. note::

    This tutorial assumes that you know how to set up and run simple binaries in S2E. If not, please refer to the
    `s2e-env <../../s2e-env.rst>`__ documentation to get started.

    Only basic block and line coverage is supported.
    Branch and function coverage is work in progress and are not supported yet.

Line coverage for Linux binaries
================================

We will use `GNU Core Utilities <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html>`__ to illustrate how to get
code coverage for Linux binaries. Coreutils are the basic file, shell and text
manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system. This part of the tutorial walks you through the process of using
S2E to analyze the ``cat`` program and generate basic block and line coverage information.


Building Coreutils
------------------

The first step is to build the coreutils package. In this tutorial, we will use version `8.26
<https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.26.tar.xz>`__ . We will build a 32-bit version of Coreutils with debug
symbols (so that we can generate line coverage).

.. code-block:: console

    wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.26.tar.xz
    tar xf coreutils-8.26.tar.xz

    cd coreutils-8.26
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure CFLAGS="-g -m32" --prefix=$(pwd)
    make
    make install

The coreutils programs will be available in ``coreutils-8.26/build/bin``.

Running Coreutils concretely in S2E
-----------------------------------

Run the following command in order to create a ``cat`` project. This will instruct S2E to run cat and display
the contents of ``/etc/fstab``. For the sake of simplicity, no symbolic execution will occur here (as the file
is concrete and we will not instruct S2E to make it symbolic).

.. code-block:: console

    s2e new_project --image debian-12.5-i386 /path/to/coreutils-8.26/build/bin/cat /etc/fstab

After creating the project, run S2E. This should take a few seconds and terminate.

.. code-block:: console

    cd projects/cat
    ./launch.s2e.sh

Generating line coverage
------------------------

``s2e-env`` generates line coverage information in the `lcov <http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php>`__ format.
The following command will generate an HTML report.

.. code-block:: console

    s2e coverage lcov --html cat

This will generate the following in ``projects/cat/s2e-last``:

* A ``cat.info`` file containing the line coverage information in lcov format
* An HTML report in the ``cat_lcov`` directory

The image below shows a snippet from the generated HTML report:

.. image:: lcov-cat-sp1.png
   :width: 640px

.. image:: lcov-cat-sp2.png
   :width: 640px

.. note::

  At the moment, S2E does not generate branch coverage or function coverage information, so these will be
  missing from the report.

Line coverage for shared libraries
==================================

By default, the S2E code coverage plugin only records coverage information for the main project binary. If the
binary uses shared libraries, you need to add them manually as follows. In this example, open the ``s2e-config.lua``
file and modify the ``ModuleExecutionDetector`` plugin configuration as follows:

.. code-block:: lua
   :caption: s2e-config.lua

    add_plugin("ModuleExecutionDetector")
    pluginsConfig.ModuleExecutionDetector = {
        mod_0 = {
            moduleName = "cat",
        },

        mod_1 = {
            # Do not forget to adapt the library name to your system.
            # You can check which library your binary uses using ldd.
            moduleName = "libc-2.24.so",
        }
    }

Then re-generate the coverage:

.. code-block:: console

    cd projects/cat && ./launch.s2e.sh
    s2e coverage lcov --html cat

The command should display errors about source code not found:

.. code-block:: console

    Processing file csu/../sysdeps/x86/libc-start.c
    genhtml: ERROR: cannot read /build/glibc-6LCJ6H/glibc-2.24/csu/../sysdeps/x86/libc-start.c
    ERROR: [lcov]

In order to fix this, download the source packages as follows. Make sure first that you have built the guest VM images
yourself and did not use the pre-built ones, otherwise the docker image ``linux-build-i386`` may be missing.

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --rm -ti -v "$HOME":"$HOME" linux-build-i386
    # In the container's Bash prompt
    cd /home/user/s2e/env/projects/cat
    echo "deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
    apt-get update
    apt-get install dpkg-dev

    # Check out the source for the i386 version, since we run tests on the 32-bit version of the binary
    apt-get source libc6:i386
    exit

After you have run the commands above, you should have the ``glibc-2.24`` folder in your project directory.
Simply re-run the code coverage command above. You should now get the following report:

.. image:: lcov-libc-sp1.png
   :width: 640px

Basic block coverage
====================

Sometimes, you do not have source code or debug information. In this case, you can use S2E to compute
basic block coverage.

``s2e-env`` provides a subcommand that generates basic block coverage. This subcommand requires either IDA Pro, Radare
or Binary Ninja to disassemble the target binary and extract the basic blocks from it. The different disassemblers have
different requirements.

- **Ida Pro**: You must specify the path to its location ``s2e-env`` config file.
- **Radare**: Radare must be installed into a location on your path and you must have the ``r2pipe`` Python package
  installed via pip (see `here <https://github.com/S2E/s2e-env/blob/master/README.md>`__ for details).
- **Binary Ninja**: You must have a Binary Ninja license that allows "GUI-less processing".

In order to produce this basic block listing you can run one of the following commands:

- ``s2e coverage basic_block --disassembler=ida cat``
- ``s2e coverage basic_block --disassembler=r2 cat``
- ``s2e coverage basic_block --disassembler=binaryninja cat``

The basic block coverage subcommand will perform a block coverage analysis on ``s2e-last`` in the ``cat`` project by
mapping translation block coverage generated by the ``TranslationBlockCoverage`` plugin to the basic block information
extracted by your disassembler. The result will be written to ``projects/cat/s2e-last/cat_coverage.json``, part of
which is shown below.

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: cat_coverage.json

    {
        "coverage": [
            {
                "end_addr": 134516923,
                "function": "__do_global_dtors_aux",
                "start_addr": 134516916
            },
            {
                "end_addr": 134516165,
                "function": ".__fpending",
                "start_addr": 134516160
            },
            {
                "end_addr": 134515758,
                "function": ".init_proc",
                "start_addr": 134515754
            },
            ...
        ],
        "stats": {
            "covered_basic_blocks": 215,
            "total_basic_blocks": 1456
        }
    }

Later we will show how you can use this basic block coverage together with your chosen disassembler.

Code coverage during symbolic execution
=======================================

So far, we have seen how to get code coverage in concrete single-path executions. Everything works the same
when symbolic execution is enabled. Each path will get its own coverage file and ``s2e-env`` will automatically
aggregate all of them to produce a coverage report. In this section, we will configure ``cat`` to use symbolic
inputs and will measure the corresponding increase in coverage.

First, create a new project called ``cat-symb`` as follows. This will re-generate a new configuration for ``cat``
with symbolic execution enabled. The project that you generated earlier in this tutorial is preserved in the ``cat``
folder.

.. code-block:: console

    s2e new_project -n cat-symb --image debian-12.5-i386 /path/to/coreutils-8.26/build/bin/cat -T @@

The ``@@`` symbol tells ``s2e-env`` to generate a bootstrap file that will run ``cat`` with a symbolic file as input.
By default this symbolic file will be a 256 byte file filled with ``null`` bytes as concolic values.

The ``-T`` option forces ``cat`` to display TAB characters (0x09). This is important because it forces ``cat`` to read
the symbolic values and fork two states - one state for the character being a TAB and another state for a character
being a non-TAB.

To make symbolic execution a bit more interesting for ``cat``, we will have to modify this symbolic file slightly.
Instead of having the symbolic file filled with ``null`` bytes, we will add some actual text to the file to make it
more representative of using ``cat``. Open ``bootstrap.sh`` and replace ``truncate -s 256 ${SYMB_FILE}`` with:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "print 'A' * 8" > ${SYMB_FILE}

Then run S2E for a moment and terminate it.

.. code-block:: console

    cd projects/cat-symb && ./launch-s2e.sh
    # ...
    # Terminate S2E after a while
    killall -9 qemu-system-i386

Finally, get the code coverage:

.. code-block:: console

    s2e coverage lcov --html cat-symb

Compare the obtained results with the previous single-path run. Line coverage percentage should be higher.

.. image:: lcov-cat-mp1.png
   :width: 640

Now generate the basic block coverage (using your chosen disassembler, in this case IDA Pro):

.. code-block:: console

    s2e coverage basic_block --disassembler=ida cat-symb

You can then use this data for further analysis. For example, the S2E `tools
<https://github.com/S2E/s2e/tree/master/tools/tools/scripts>`__ contain an IDA Pro script to highlight the basic blocks
covered by S2E during analysis. This script can be found at ``install/bin/ida_highlight_basic_blocks.py`` in your S2E
environment. To run the script, open the ``cat`` binary in IDA Pro, select "Script file" from the "File" menu and open
``install/bin/ida_highlight_basic_blocks.py``. You will be prompted for the ``basic_block_coverage.json`` file generated
by S2E. Select this file and the basic blocks executed by S2E will be colored green. Depending on how long you let S2E
run for and how many translation blocks it executed, you should get a graph similar to the following:

.. image:: ida_cat_coverage.png
   :width: 640

Examining the debug log in ``s2e-last/debug.txt`` you should see a fork at address 0x8049ADE. If you look at this
address in IDA Pro, you should see a ``cmp [ebp+ch_0], 9`` at the previous instruction (address 0x8049ADA). This is
``cat`` checking if the current character is a TAB or not (as previously mentioned the ASCII value for TAB is 0x09).
Because the file contains symbolic data, a fork will occur at the ``jnz`` instruction.

Similarly, Radare can be used to annotate the basic blocks covered by S2E with `metadata
<https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/disassembling/adding_metadata.html>`__. This script can be found at
``install/bin/r2_highlight_basic_blocks.py`` in your S2E environment. To run the script, open the ``cat`` binary in
Radare as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    r2 -i install/bin/r2_highlight_basic_blocks.py projects/cat-symb/cat

You will be prompted for the ``basic_block_coverage.json`` file generated by S2E. Enter the path to this file and the
basic blocks executed by S2E will be annotated with a ``Covered by S2E`` comment. The image below illustrates this.

.. image:: r2_cat_coverage.png
   :width: 640

How does S2E record and compute coverage?
=========================================

In this section, we will take a step back and explain at a high level what components of S2E are involved to
generate coverage. This is useful in case you would like to extend S2E to generate other types of coverage.

S2E takes as input a virtual machine and a configuration file, and outputs JSON files that contain a list of
executed program counters that belong to the modules specified in the configuration file. A module is essentially
a binary file that can be loaded and executed by the guest OS (``.exe``, ``.so``, ``.dll``, etc.),
whether in user or kernel space.

S2E relies on three plugins to generate coverage data: an OS monitor, a module execution detector, and
a coverage generator plugin. These plugins are all enabled by default in ``s2e-config.lua`` when creating a project
with ``s2e-env``. The job of the OS monitor (e.g., ``WindowsMonitor`` or ``LinuxMonitor``) is to monitor various
system events, such as module loads/unloads, and notify any interested plugins about them. One such plugin is the
module execution detector (``ModuleExecutionDetector``). This plugin reacts to events from the OS monitor
in order to notify its own clients about instructions executed by the modules of interest. The module execution
detector filters out all the other instructions that do not belong to the modules of interest. Finally, the code
coverage plugin (i.e., ``TranslationBlockCoverage``) connects to the module execution detector plugin in order to
record executed instructions.

The S2E coverage plugin records coverage during code *translation* rather than code *execution* in order to be more
efficient. The S2E execution engine continuously fetches blocks of guest code, translates them to host code, and
packages this host code into *translation blocks*. S2E stores translation blocks in a cache in order to avoid redundant
translations and speed up execution (e.g., if guest code executes a loop). The ``TranslationBlockCoverage`` plugin
listens for guest code translation events and records the start and end address of the block, as well as the size
of the block. S2E however only provides raw virtual addresses and the coverage plugin must first convert them to
addresses that are relative to the module's base address. ``TranslationBlockCoverage`` calls ``ModuleExecutionDetector``
in order to do the conversion. After that, it records the converted addresses in the JSON file. This conversion is
important, as raw virtual addresses may be different from run to run (relocations, ASLR, etc.).

Generating basic block coverage requires an off-line conversion step from translation blocks to basic blocks.
A translation block (TB) is a sequence of instructions that ends with a control flow change (e.g., call, jump).
A basic block (BB) is a translation block with the additional constraint that it may have only one entry. As a result,
a TB may span one or more BBs. A TB may also start in the middle of a basic block due to how the code
translator works (a TB may be interrupted at any time by an exception, and when execution returns, the translator
starts a fresh TB from the current program counter). The conversion will therefore take one TB and output all the BBs
it overlaps. This set of covered BBs will then be compared to the total set of BBs of the module in order to compute
basic block coverage.

Generating line coverage is simpler: just translate each address in ``[tb_start, tb_start + tb_size[`` to a source
file, line number, and function name using the debug information. ``s2e-env`` relies on the DWARF information stored
in the binary in order to get this information and package it into a coverage file understood by LCOV.


.. note::

    ``TranslationBlockCoverage`` only supports line/basic block coverage. It does not support branch coverage yet.
    A branch coverage plugin would have to instrument branch instructions and record their outcome. The plugin
    would listen to code translation events, check if the translated instruction is a branch, and if so insert
    instrumentation code. This code would then determine the ``(source_pc, target_pc)`` pair and record it in the
    coverage file. ``source_pc`` is the address of the current branch instruction and ``target_pc`` is already
    stored in the program counter register when the instrumentation runs.


Line coverage for the Linux kernel
==================================

The Linux kernel is just another module as far as S2E is concerned. Recording coverage for it works like for any
other program.

.. warning::

    Make sure you build S2E images yourself. Do not use the pre-built ones as the source information will not match
    the Linux source on your system and the coverage report may be empty.

1. Create a new project or pick an existing one. The analysis target does not matter, so you may also create
   an empty project. In your S2E environment:

   .. code-block:: console

       s2e new_project -n linux-kernel -i debian-12.5-x86_64 --no-target --type linux

2. Add ``vmlinux`` to the ``ModuleExecutionDetector`` plugin configuration:

   .. code-block:: lua
       :caption: s2e-config.lua

       add_plugin("ModuleExecutionDetector")
       pluginsConfig.ModuleExecutionDetector = {
           mod_vmlinux = {
            moduleName = "vmlinux",
           }
       }

3. Open ``bootstrap.sh`` and add the following commands right before the kill state command at the end of the script:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: bootstrap.sh

        ...

        # Flush the CPU translation block cache.
        # This ensures that the code coverage plugin catches as much of the kernel as possible.
        # Omitting it may under-report coverage.
        # This command may go anywhere, but generally right before your workload.
        ${S2ECMD} flush_tbs

        # Run a kernel-intensive utility here
        find /usr

        # Kill states before exiting
        ${S2ECMD} kill $? "Target execution terminated"

   Alternatively, if you specified a binary to analyze during project creation, add ``${S2ECMD} flush_tbs``
   to the ``execute_target`` function in ``bootstrap.sh`` as follows.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: bootstrap.sh

        function execute_target {
            local TARGET
            TARGET="$1"
            SYMB_FILE="$(prepare_inputs)"

            # ...

            # This command may go anywhere, but generally right before your workload
            ${S2ECMD} flush_tbs

            # Run a kernel-intensive utility here
            find /

            # ...
        }

4. Run S2E. The ``TranslationBlockCoverage`` plugins writes coverage files when states terminate so make sure
   at least one state is completed before killing S2E.

   .. code-block:: console

       cd projects/linux-kernel
       ./launch-s2e.sh

5. Generate line coverage information. Do not forget the ``--include-covered-files-only`` option to keep the report
   as short as possible (source files with no coverage will be omitted).

   .. code-block:: console

       s2e coverage lcov --html --include-covered-files-only linux-kernel

   This should produce a report that looks like this:

   .. image:: linux-cov.png
      :width: 640px

Line coverage for Windows binaries
==================================

Line coverage support for Windows binaries is currently in progress. There are two main cases:

1. Using embedded DWARF information in the executable file.
   ``s2e-env`` combines ``pefile`` with ``pyelftools`` in order to read DWARF information from PE files.
   Line coverage should work properly for Windows binaries compiled with DWARF information (clang, mingw, etc.).

2. Using the PDB file produced by Microsoft compilers.
   This format is not officially documented. Microsoft released some
   `source code <https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-pdb>`__ that helped LLVM add support for it, so Python parsers
   should come soon too. In the meantime, S2E provides a tool that converts PDB files to a JSON format
   that can be read by ``s2e-env``.

   The Windows device driver testing `tutorial <../../Tutorials/WindowsDrivers/FaultInjection.rst>`__
   shows in details how to obtain line coverage for Windows kernel binaries.


Debugging code coverage
=======================

The typical symptom is that the coverage report is empty. Here is a checklist to help with debugging:

- Check that your binaries have debug information. Recompile them if needed. For Windows binaries, make sure
  you generated the ``.lines`` file as instructed by the coverage tool.

- Make sure the source code is available at the same location as when the binary was built. In most cases,
  ``s2e-env`` will guess the proper location if you place the source in the project's directory.

- If you do not get any coverage for the Linux kernel, check that you built the guest images on the same machine
  where you run S2E (or at least all the files are at the same locations).
  You cannot use pre-built images as their source paths are unlikely to match those on your machine.

- Check that the ``tb-coverage*.json`` files contain adequate data. If they do not exist, check that you terminated
  S2E after at least one state completed. Alternatively, you can use the ``writeCoveragePeriod`` option of the
  ``TranslationBlockCoverage`` plugin in order to periodically dump coverage of the currently running state.
  If coverage files are empty or are missing some modules, check that the S2E configuration is correct.

- Check that ``ModuleExecutionDetector`` in ``s2e-config.lua`` is configured properly. If a module is missing,
  ``TranslationBlockCoverage`` will not generate any coverage information for it.

- Check that the ``Vmi`` plugin in ``s2e-config.lua`` is configured properly. You do not normally need to touch
  this plugin as it is automatically configured with the right settings. If however you have a project generated with
  an older version of ``s2e-env``, you may need to add new entries. It must have at a minimum the following entries:

  .. code-block:: lua

     pluginsConfig.Vmi = {
         baseDirs = {
             "/home/user/s2e/env/projects/my-project",
             "/home/user/s2e/env/projects/my-project/guest-tools",
             "/home/user/s2e/env/projects/my-project/guestfs"
         }
     }

  The OS monitor plugin may not be able to find your binaries if these search paths are missing.

- Check that your project directory contains a symlink to guestfs:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ ls -l /home/user/s2e/env/projects/my_project
        ...
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user      51 Apr  8 18:34 guestfs -> /mnt/home3/guest-images/debian-12.5-x86_64/guestfs
        ...

- Check that ``projects/my_project/guestfs/vmlinux`` is valid and contains line information (try ``addr2line``)

- Check that you did not delete temporary image build files, in particular the Linux source code.

  .. code-block:: console

      $ ls -l images/.tmp-output/linux-4.9.3-x86_64/linux-4.9.3/
      drwxrwxr-x  34 user user      4096 Apr 13 19:22 arch
      drwxrwxr-x   3 user user      4096 Apr 13 19:14 block
      drwxrwxr-x   2 user user      4096 Apr 13 19:12 certs

      ...
