============================================
Copying files between the host and the guest
============================================

The ``s2eget`` and ``s2eput`` tools allow transfering files between the guest virtual machine and the host during
symbolic execution even when there is no network available. If you use ``s2e-env`` and stock VM images, these two
utilities are already included in the guest VM.

``s2eget``
----------

In order to copy a file from the host to the guest VM, add the following command to the desired location in
your ``bootstrap.sh``:

.. code-block:: console

    ./s2eget <filename>

``<filename>`` specifies the file to copy from the host into the guest. Note that the filename argument to ``s2eget``
must be specified relative to the ``HostFiles`` plugin base directory (see below).

If ``<filename>`` is an executable file that you want to run, you may use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    ./s2eget <filename> && chmod +x ./<filename> && ./<filename>

.. note::

    To see a real example of how to use this command, have a look at the ``bootstrap.sh`` file generated by ``s2e-env``.
    This script already contains several invocations of ``s2eget``, which copy the binary to analyze from the host to
    the guest VM, together with several other support files.


``s2eput``
----------

To copy a file ``fileName`` from the guest to the host, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    ./s2eput fileName

This uploads ``fileName`` in the guest to the ``s2e-last/outfiles`` directory on the host. This is useful, e.g., if a
program that you are analyzing generates a core dump and you want to inspect it on your host.

.. note::

    The upload will fail if a file with the same name already exists in the outfiles directory.


Setting up the HostFiles Plugin
-------------------------------

``s2eget`` and ``s2eput`` require configuring the ``HostFiles`` plugin in the S2E configuration file
(``s2e-config.lua``). The configuration looks as follows:

.. code-block:: lua

    plugins = {
        ...

        "HostFiles",
    }

    pluginsConfig.HostFiles = {
        baseDirs = {
            "/path/to/host/dir1",
            "/path/to/host/dir2",
        },

        -- This option must be enabled for s2eput to work
        allowWrite = true,
    }

.. note::

    If you use s2e-env, the basic configuration is already there. You do not have to modify it unless you need
    to access files that are stored outside of your project folder. Do not change the existing directory configuration
    (in particular guestfs folder paths).


The ``pluginsConfig.HostFiles.baseDirs`` configuration option specifies what directories on the host should be shared
with the guest. The paths can be either absolute, relative, or empty. If an empty directory is specified the S2E output
directory will be exported.

The ``pluginsConfig.HostFiles.allowWrite`` must be set to ``true`` for allowing writes to the base directories.
